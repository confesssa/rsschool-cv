### **SUMMARY**
When I was in high school, computer science was one of my favorite subjects. One day, the teacher gave us a task as homework: to create a sample webpage: I remember that night I could not sleep and spent all the time doing my homework, and in the process I had much fun. Unfortunately after that my life took a different turn, and for a long time my interest were directed to completely different fields. Now, after more than 10 years, I decided to change the field of activity and try myself as a developer, taking that long-forgotten path which had once appeared in my life. At the moment I am a student at RS.School, and I have the ambition of becoming a full-fledged web developer. There is much to do and to learn, but I feel very motivated and ready to face this exciting challenge.
