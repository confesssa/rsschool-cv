        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>When I was in high school, computer science was one of my favorite subjects. One day, the teacher gave us a task as homework: to create a sample webpage: I remember that night I could not sleep and spent all the time doing my homework, and in the process I had much fun. Unfortunately after that my life took a different turn, and for a long time my interest were directed to completely different fields. Now, after more than 10 years, I decided to change the field of activity and try myself as a developer, taking that long-forgotten path which had once appeared in my life. At the moment I am a student at <a href="https://rs.school/js/">RS.School</a>, and I have the ambition of becoming a full-fledged web developer. There is much to do and to learn, but I feel very motivated and ready to face this exciting challenge.</p>

        <h3>English</h3>
        <p>I learnt English at school as anybody else, but didn't use it on a daily basis for a certain amount of time. At the moment I have a pre-intermediate (A2) level of English. I practice English reading articles, listening to podcasts, as well as communicating with foreigners.</p>
